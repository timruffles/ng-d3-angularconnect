## I had a moment of doubt
{tags:{state:"bad"}}

## Why do all the apps I build look the same?

## Why did people new to D3 + ng build cooler stuff than me?

## Something was wrong with me

## Programmer vision

## A world of hierarchy

## ...and rules

## Where simple things were impossible

## Where doing it the 'right way'

## Was more important than doing it at all
