## I had a moment of doubt

## Why do all the apps I build look the same?

## Why did people new to D3 + ng build cooler stuff than me?

## Maybe there was something wrong with me

## Maybe I had been indoctrinated

## Then I realised

## I had developed

## Programmer vision

## A world of hierarchy

## ...and rules

## Where simple things were impossible

## 
{todo: "programmer vision"}
